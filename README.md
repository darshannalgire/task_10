 Overview

This project covers:

* Building an **encoder-decoder model** with attention.
* Training on English-French sentence pairs.
* Saving and loading the **trained model** and **tokenizers**.
* Translating **new English sentences** into French with the trained model.

---

 Features

* Encoder-Decoder LSTM with attention mechanism.
* Handles variable-length English and French sentences.
* Supports teacher forcing during training.
* Ready-to-use for new sentence translation.

If you want, I can also **enhance it with a project description, objective, and example translations section** so it looks even more professional and GitHub-ready. Do you want me to do that?
